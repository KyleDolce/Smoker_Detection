# Smoker Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project is an exploration into the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in classifying images to detect smoking behavior. The aim is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to a challenging and nuanced task like smoker detection.

## About the Project

This project uses a CNN to predict whether a person in a photo is smoking. The model was trained on a diverse dataset and went through several iterations to improve its accuracy and reduce overfitting. The journey from the initial complex model to the final refined version is a tale of learning and adapting in the field of AI and machine learning.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model.
- Employs techniques like one-hot encoding, hyperparameter tuning, and callbacks like Early Stopping and Model Checkpoints.
- Integrates Weights and Biases for experiment tracking and performance visualization.
- Contains detailed documentation and reflections on the model's performance and future improvement areas.
